
Summary of changes from release 2.21 to release 3.00 b10
(all previous HISTORY text has been removed and archived)
---------------------------------------------------------

  This is a very major release, encompassing changes to virtually *all* the
subsections of the program. It also includes the addition of many more user
defaults, which means the .INI version has changed.


* The program is now in "dynamic overlay" format. This means that you
  cannot compress it with DIET, LZEXE, PKLITE, etc.


* Added the new HELP screen. Pressing (or clicking) F1 in a function will
  bring up help for that function. Getting help when sitting at the command
  line will bring up the help index. You can select any topic from there to
  get help on.

  * The HLP file is compressed and encoded, so don't bother to try to work
    with it.

  * If no HELP file exists, you will now get an error window, with the
    directory path of where the file should be located, so you know where
    to put it.

* Added a "README.TXT" file, intended to cover some of the more basic
  installation problems you might see when using the program. I have
  included all the common questions that I have seen.


* The program will now run on older machines without math co-processors.
  Some time ago, I started using FLOAT variables, but I neglected to tell
  the compiler to *use* the floating point emulation libraries. Without the
  libraries, the program would run intermittenly on anything less than a
  486 (i.e. 386, 286 etc), and usually not at all (crashed so hard even a
  C-A-D wouldn't work!)


* Major visual changes to the windows/dialog boxes:

  * Added the mouse. Left button is for selection, right button is for
    cancelling windows, or tagging/untagging files in the panels.

  * Keys pressed while holding a mouse button down are detected and acted
    on. This means you can select a menu, and press a menu hotkey (like
    F1), while the button is still down.

  * Rewrote the way I define/draw/remove windows. This change affected
    *all* the windows, making each one completely configurable (by me).

  * Wrote a generic button controller, to handle all the [ ], ( ),
    OK/CANCEL, text/numeric input and list items.

  * With the inclusion of a button controller, I now support OK/CANCEL at
    the bottom of most windows, a la Norton Commander. Even though I have
    removed the "y/n/c?" section from all dialog boxes, most of the time
    you can still press 'Y' or 'N' where you use to, but there will be
    exceptions. You can also select the option with the keyboard. The ESC
    key will still cancel the dialog.

  * Added in margins on the windows (Confirmation windows)

  * Added in single/double-width window borders

  * Added in a "shadow line" to the windows for the "3D" depth look.

  * Moved most of the "confirmation windows" ("Are you sure...") to the
    confirmation window color (see Color Configuration for more)

  * Rewrote the subroutine that sends text into a window. This has affected
    *all* windows, and there may still be lingering problems. This re-write
    was necessary because of an inherent design flaw dealing with
    bold/underline and text alignment (left/center/right) combinations.

  * The red ERROR windows are now multi-line for easier reading and can
    contain longer messages. I have reformatted some of the error messages
    to take advantage of this.

  * Re-wrote the way I write directly to the video buffer to be a little
    smaller, and more efficient, and eliminated some smaller subroutines in
    the process..

  * I can now have multi-color text on one line (see the Switch Panel Drive
    text for an example)

  * When entering *any* function, the Fkeys are cleared, and will display
    *only* the Fkeys that are applicable to that function. So if the
    function does not support F2 (whatever that may be), you won't see it
    on the Fkey bar.

  * Added a "Turn off panels" click button to the top-left of the screen.
    Clicking on this button will remove the panels, or bring them back. If
    you are in a full-screen function (Editor), then this button acts like
    you pressed F10 (Exit function)

  * Corrected a universal program bug dealing with creation and destruction
    of windows. I was not tracking the window handles properly (under
    *very* specific circumstances), but I felt it necessary to make the
    correction program-wide. Virtually every function has been slightly
    altered, but hopefully none of the windows will misbehave.

  * Since I did the above handle fix, I also decided it was high time to
    fix some other things, like how I track window handles throughout the
    program. This resulted in a universal change to many subroutines
    dealing with window colors, drawing lines, buttons, writing text into a
    window, etc.

  * Re-wrote the way I draw the percentage and progress bars, due to
    reports of the bar graphs sometimes being drawn outside of the window
    borders.


* Re-arranged the window layout of the some routines:

  * F11 (Convert Files) and F12 (Create Archive file) window to allow for
    the future addition of more archive formats. The old windows had very
    little room left for expansion. You can now type the number
    corresponding to the format you want (1 for D64, 6 for LNX in the
    Convert window, the Create window is different)

  * Shift-F9 (PETASCII to ASCII Conversion) to allow for more text
    conversion types.

  * Added short-cut keys to the Color Config and Configuration windows. By
    pressing the number beside the list entry, you can jump directly into
    that area, bypassing the cursors and the mouse.

  * Added option under MISCELLANEOUS page called "Keep file/dir time/date
    on copy". This allows you to control whether the time and date of
    directories and files will be stamped onto the new files when
    copying/moving. It is defaulted to "on".


* Added drop-down menus on (mouseclick at the top of the screen, or F9).
  They speak for themselves! Some of the new options include:

   * Panel sort type/direction
   * File display, tag filters and panel style for each panel
   * Configuration
   * Save settings
   * Fkeybar on/off
   * Path prompt display on/off
   * Full screen or short (60% of screen) panel display

  * I also disable (grey out) menu items when the function is not available
    (especially obvious when the panels are off)

  * Releasing the ALT key when in the main panel display will drop the
    menus. Added the option to turn this off under Configuration,
    Miscellaneous option.


* Several (maybe serious) bugs were discovered regarding storing files in
  T64's:

  * The END address stored in the directory entry was two bytes too high.
    This would cause load/execution problems with certain sized files.

  * Instead of storing the real C64 filetype ($82, $83, etc) in the entry,
    I was storing a $01... this was a misunderstanding from Miha's
    documentation regarding the T64 structure. It didn't seem to make too
    much difference, as people have been using T64's created with 64COPY
    for some time.


* Added support for the 40 track format and error bytes:

  * Added auto-detection of the extended D64 DOS type. If you hit return on
    an extended D64, and the DOS type appears to be different from the
    Configuration setting (Speed or Dolphin), you will be asked if you want
    to use the different DOS format.

  * The F12 "Create Images" will now create an extended D64 file, with 40
    track and error bytes, if you have selected this in the Emulator page
    of the Configuration window. If you haven't selected this, you can
    still specify it when the window comes up asking for the name of the
    D64 as there is a button asking "[ ] use extended format".

  * If the Conversion routine calls for creating a D64 file, and you have
    selected "Use 40 track images" and/or "Append error bytes" in the
    Configuration, that is what you will get. You will not be able to
    change it.

  * I now display the track size and error byte status of the open D64. If
    it is a normal 35 track image, there is a "(35)" appended to the panel
    title. If it is a special 40 track image, there is a "(40)" appended.
    If there are error bytes appended, then an "/E" will also be shown in
    the panel header: "(40/E)"

  * Added display of the extended D64 DOS type to the panel title bar. If
    the disk format is "Speed DOS", a "S/" will be present. If it is
    "Dolphin DOS" a "D/" will be present.

  * When creating a D64, the type of the file (track size, error bytes) is
    also present in the dialog box... "FILENAME.D64 (35/E)"

  * The maximum value used for the user-definable "Blocks Free" in the BAM
    Editor and the Directory Editor are now based on available tracks
    (35/40)*255, rather than a static value of 8670.

  * The BAM Editor now displays either the 35 or 40 track layout (they are
    slightly different). Tracks 36-40 are displayed in a smaller block at
    the end of track 35, if they exist.

  * D64 HEX Editor, BAM Editor, Directory Editor, CheckDisk and Convert are
    all 40-track aware.

  * Added an "error byte editor" into the D64 HEX editor on ALT-E. It works
    like the BAM Editor (looks almost identical).

  * CheckZip will now check 4-part (35 track) and 5-part (40 track)
    ZipCodes.

  * D64-to-ZipCode will now recognize and encode 40 track D64's into 5 part
    ZipCodes.

  * ZipCode-to-D64 also recognizes 5-part ZipCodes (40 tracks). If you try
    to specify the file to be created as an X64, you will be overridden.

  * D64 Hex Editor will now display the error associated with the sector.


* Added in a PETASCII to ASCII text converter on SHIFT-F9. Simply select
  the files you want converted, and start. It only works on DOS binary
  files, so convert the files you need from any emulator format (D64, P00)
  to DOS first. Remember, the converted file will be created in the
  opposite panel. You can either allow the converter to use its default
  "Auto-Detect" mode, or you can override the setting by selecting another
  conversion type.

  It works on several different types of text, and will auto-detect what
  type of conversion to use. The conversion type will be displayed in the
  progress indicator.

  * Auto-detect format - This will analyse the text, and determine the best
                         form of conversion for you. This is always the
                         default.

  * Mostly DOS text - the detected text appears to be already in DOS text
                      format, in the hex range of 60-7F (lower case),
                      except possibly for upper case and CR and CR/LF
                      codes. The text will not be converted, except the CR
                      will be converted to CR/LF.

  * Standard PETASCII (40) - This is the normal style of PETASCII,
                             contained in the hex ranges of 40-5F (lower
                             case) and C0-DF (upper case). Text will be
                             converted down to the normal ASCII ranges,
                             along with CR and CR/LF conversion.

  * Low PETASCII (00) - This is text stored as screen pokes, occupying the
                        hex ranges of 00-1F (lower case) and 40-5F (upper
                        case). This format has the special problem of using
                        text in the range usually reserved for CR and
                        CR/LF. The codes used for CR and CR/LF vary between
                        each word processor, but I have attempted to find
                        all the typical codes used.

  * The conversion will not be perfect, as it only converts the text
    portions of the data, and not the control codes/graphics (except CR).
    Linefeeds (LF) will be discarded, and re-inserted. This will likely
    result in unwanted characters mixed in with the converted text.
    PaperClip files tend to be bad when it comes to having extra
    characters, as the files include a lot of control sequences throughout.
    Each word processor uses its own method of storing files, including
    special codes.

  * Some files are stored in a "40 column" format, where instead of a CR
    used to end a line or a paragraph, spaces have been used to format the
    text to fit a 40 column screen. When converted, these files do not
    display properly, and will need some editing to get them to look
    reasonable.

  * Added the "[ ] Auto-convert filenames" button to the main window. This
    is the same setting that is available in the configuration window under
    "Emulator Conversion"

  * Added some German character customization to the conversion tables for
    VizaWrite and StarTtexter word processors.


* Some changes to the EXT file support:

  * Added three new keywords to be used in the command area of the EXT
    file. Use these where you would normally state what program to run.
    This way you can use internal routines, without the delay of loading
    the program back in. Note that the case of the keywords is not
    important. Also, the commands listed are in order of execution
    priority. If a command contains two specials, i.e. '@hex @edit', then
    the '@edit' command will be executed as it has a higher priority than
    the other, regardless of the visible order.

    '@EDIT' for the internal text editor
    '@VIEW' for the internal file viewer
    '@HEX'  for the internal hex editor

  * The EXTension file now supports "filename.ext" definitions, and not
    just "ext" definitions. Now, if you need to do something based on the
    filename as well as the extension, you can define it like "file*.ext :
    command".

  * The EXT file can now use the "'" character as a comment (as is used in
    Norton Commaner) along with the ";" command I always used.


* I changed the way I save the settings when the program is exited. I still
  save the INI, but I moved the User Menu information to the new .MNU file,
  and I also save the colors to the .CLR file, rather than saving them in
  the INI as well. This makes it easier for me to make changes to the INI
  without having you lose your color configuration and/or user menu
  definitions.


* Changes to the panel display:

  * All emulator files displayed now have a "Label" line at the bottom of
    the panel. Those that don't have labels (ARK/LBR/PC64) will say "Image
    file has no label".

  * Added display/support for "unclosed" or "Splat" files. These are the
    "*" files in a normal D64 directory. They are checked for in the
    CheckDisk function, and if one is found, you will asked to correct the
    file type (all other things like filesize and BAM entries will already
    be taken care of).

  * The panel header is appended with a "(R)" when an image file is opened
    that is "read-only", such as LBR and ARK.

  * Re-wrote the way panels are displayed (i.e. the layout of the columns),
    so that they are much more configurable.

  * Added date/time to the panel display, and therefore have removed the
    displaying of the file attributes. Attributes can still be viewed and
    changed from the Ctrl-A function.

  * Files are now displayed in lower case, directories in upper case.

  * File sizes in D64 archives will now be displayed with their full value,
    and not as "999" if they are over 999 blocks.

  * Changed the File Info area to give all the info about what file the
    hilite bar is on (the same as that given in the panel)

  * Each panel can now have the "Disk free" and "File info" lines turned
    off, from the Panel Setup menu (under Left or Right menu)

  * Fixed the scroll bars for the panels. Now when they are dragged, they
    should move to *exactly* where you click. Note, this depends on how
    many files are being displayed. If there is barely enough to show the
    scroll bars, clicking in the bar will prodice somewhat jumpy results.
    This is normal.

  * File date's with the year over 1999 (the "year 2000" problem) would get
    displayed as "10" rather than "00" (it was a truncation of numbers
    greater than 100)

  * Fixed the function CTRL-MINUS (back up 1 directory) so that if you are
    in an archive file, it will back out of that one first, like it was in
    a directory. Any subsequent CTRL-MINUS's will back up through the
    directories like normal.

  * Added CTRL-PAGEUP. This behaves like CTRL-MINUS, backing you out of
    archive files, or up 1 directory.

  * Added CTRL-PAGEDOWN. This behaves like you are hitting return on the
    item under the hilite bar. If you are on an archive file, you will go
    into it.

  * Sped up display of panel file information. I was updating the panel
    scroll bar display after displaying *any* panel line, not after the
    panel was completely drawn, thus slowing down quite substantially the
    panel drawing.

  * Tagging files in an archive file with unusually high block counts would
    cause the status line to display the wrong numbers.

  * The panel status line display was wrong (and could crash the machine)
    when you tagged D64 files with block counts > 32767 blocks.


* Changed the User Menu to add more '!' features. This makes the '!'
  options the same as Star Commander, with some other additions. No longer
  will just using '!' include both the filename and the extension, they
  must be specified as follows.

  '!.!' - include full filename under the hilite bar, with extension
  '!'   - include just the filename under the hilite bar, no extension
  '!F'  - same as '!'
  '!E'  - include just the file extension of the file under the hilite bar
          (without the preceeding '.' character, you have to add this
          yourself)
  '!#'  - include a list of tagged files from the the active panel on the
          command line
  '!@'  - generate list of tagged files from the active window, if any
          tagged, and put them in the 64COPY.LST file, contained in the
          same directory as 64COPY is executed from.
  '!A'  - include active archive file (i.e. BLAKHAWK.D64) if applicable
  '!:'  - include drive letter only
  '!\'  - include path only, no drive letter
  '!D'  - include drive and directory of the active panel (without the
          ending '\' character. You must include this yourself)
  '!!'  - include a '!' character

  * These options can be combined in any way you need. i.e. "pkzip !.zip
    @!@" will do a PKZIP on the filename that the hilite bar is on but with
    the extension ".zip" instead, and include the list of tagged files in
    64COPY.LST. You can also stack the commands right next to each other
    like "!D\!A\!" to concatenate the active directory, active archive
    file, and active filename, with separating '\' characters. Note that
    the case of the command ("!F" or "!f") is not important.

  * Hitting CTRL-ENTER will copy the selected entry onto the command line,
    but will not execute it.


* The EXT file also supports the '!' commands above, the same ones as the
  User Menu. However, if no '!' commands are included in the command area,
  the FILENAME.EXT is automatically added in. If you include *any* '!'
  commands in the command area, the FILENAME.EXT will *not* be
  automatically added, and the '!' commands will be expanded as specified.

  Note that combining the '!' and '@' commands are pointless. If a '!'
  command is on the same line as a '@' command, the '@' command will take
  precedence, and the entire command line will be discarded in order to
  pass the FILENAME.EXT to the internal function.


* Removed the really annoying time lag when starting the program. I owe a
  BIG THANK YOU to Joe Forster (author of Star Commander), whose theory as
  to what was causing the problem was right on the money.

  He investigated the Borland Pascal "crt" routines and found that the
  DELAY function would actually pause the program for about 1 second before
  executing the main code. It was timing how many operations could be
  executed in 1 second, and basing all DELAY values from this. Once I
  removed all useage of the Watcom DELAY function, the execution delay
  vanished.


* Because of the removal of the Watcom DELAY routine, I now employ several
  different methods to handle timed delays, but there is very little
  noticible difference from the old method. You will see a dialog box come
  up when the program is first run saying "Calculating first pause",
  meaning that the delay value needs to be calculated, and it is doing do
  so now. This *should* only happen when the program is run for the first
  time, or the INI version changes. This delay value is stored in the INI.


* Changes to the D64 Directory Editor:

  * Items are no longer left tagged after a move/duplicate/lock toggle

  * Numbers entered into the RelTr, RelSe or RelLen areas would not be put
    into the correct location of the directory and would come out very
    different than what was entered.

  * Removed functions "Clear Entries" and "Insert Blanks" as they were
    unnecessary.

  * Removed display of "Tagged Items" and "Max Entries" from the status
    bar, and replaced them with "Blocks Free" count and "Soft Write
    Protection" status. The maximum number of the entries in the directory
    is now the length of the list.

  * Moved "Duplicate Entries" to F6.

  * Added "Save Changes" to F4.

  * Added "Write protect files" toggle on F9.

  * Added detection of read-only images. If the one you want to edit is
    write-protected, you will be allowed to view only.

  * Added toggling of "soft write-protect" on Alt-F9. Soft write protection
    acts very similarly to hardware write-protection in that any write
    attempt to such a disk (on a 1541) will result in an error message.

  * Added UNDO feature on ALT-U.

  * Added user-changeable "Blocks Free" on ALT-F1. This allows you to enter
    a "blocks free" value up to 8670.

  * Added Set Message capability on ALT-F3. With this, you can type in a
    text message, and it will be put into the unused area of the BAM block,
    starting at position $B0. The message can be up to 80 characters and
    will automatically be converted to PETASCII. It will also be retained
    between edits, so it only need to be entered once.

  * Added in Get Message on ALT-F4. With this you can retrieve a message
    from the $B0-FF area of the BAM sector.

  * Added View Message Area on ALT-F5.

  * Any changes made (Soft-write, file lock/unlock, editing) are not saved
    until the editor is exited. Then you are asked if you want to save
    changes.

  * Changed Clear Columns (F2) to Set Columns. Now, you can change any
    column to any value you want, including filenames.

  * Values entered into blank entries will cause the entry to be cleared
    out first, removing the old entry info.

  * Out-of-range values for the SIZE field will no longer be displayed as
    negative integers.

  * Added in a link to the BAM editor on ALT-B. You will be asked to save
    your changes first, and I would recommend you do so, as once the BAM
    editor is finished, the Dir editor will re-start, losing all your
    changes. The Dir editor is totally dependant on the BAM, and changing
    it means I must re-start it.

  * You can now enter file sizes up to 65535 (no more 999 block limit)

  * Added checking for bad BAM's (incorrect "blocks free" count), and if it
    is found, you will be warned about the dangers of editing the BAM.

  * Trying to do an Insert Separator (F7) when the cursor was at the top of
    the list, would crash the program.

  * Added lines separating the columns.

  * Couldn't enter numbers properly into the last 5 columns

  * Added SPLAT file capability

  * Changed the F2 "Set Column" window when doing a set column on the File
    Type to allow for locking and unclosed (SPLAT) files. Re-wrote the way
    the attributes are changed.


* Some changes to the F5/F6 Rename/Move code:

  * Added the "Log disk errors to file" button to the main copy/move
    windows. This is the same button from the Miscellaneous window for "Log
    DOS copy/move errors"

  * Cancelling the dialog for entering the log path (if you selected to log
    disk errors) would result in the opposite panels' path being corrupted.


* Changes to the Text Editor:

  * The Text Editor would not paste text at the cursor position if you were
    on a blank line. It would go the beginning of the line in that case.

  * When saving a tagged block in the Text Editor, the displayed filename
    of the file being edited was being changed to the name of the saved
    block.

  * The Text Editor would allow you to save files/tagged blocks without
    checking if the filename already existed. Any existing file with the
    same name would be overwritten.

  * Added a Config screen on Alt-F11 (replacing the "Set line width" key).
    This is almost a duplicate of all the options from the main Alt-F6
    program configuration Editors/Viewers page, but it also includes text
    editor-specific options.

  * You couldn't do a Block Format in the Text Editor when at the end of
    the last line of a document.

  * Moved the "Block Format line width" control to the Text Editor config
    window (Alt-F11).

  * The Fkey bar will still show up at the bottom, even if it is *turned*
    off from the main menus.

  * Put in a status window when searching or searching/replacing text. You
    use to just sit and stare at a blinking cursor, not know what was
    happening.

  * Reduced the screen jump from 30 to 5 when exceeding the right limit of
    the screen.

  * The Cut Text (KEYPADMINUS) function was simply removing the text,
    without remembering it for future pastes.

  * Files with sizes exact multiples of 2048 (i.e. 18432) would not load
    properly (i.e. they would fill up the edit buffer, then stop loading).

  * Changed the Search/Replace "text found" box, and I now show the "found
    text", highlighted, at the top of the screen.

  * When deleting marked text in the Text editor, and you deleted the first
    line of the marked block, the tag start and end markers would get
    re-calculated incorrectly.

  * "Search/Replace" was broken when searching for single characters. If
    there were several side by side which matched the search parameters,
    every other one would be skipped.

  * Deleting the last line of a text doc with ALT-D (or F3), then typing in
    a long line and doing a Block Format (ALT B), the total line count
    would be short by one, and you couldn't get to the last line.

  * If you deleted a whole line, and on that line was a small tagged area,
    then the tag start/end markers would not be cleared.

  * When hitting RETURN at the beginning of a tagged block, the hilite
    would still be left on the line. If you paged ahead and then back, the
    hilite would no longer be there, as it should be.

  * Added ALT-KEYPADPLUS and ALT-KEYPADMINUS. These are similar to the
    already existing KEYPADPLUS (copy to common clipboard) and KEYPADMINUS
    (cut to common clipboard), but these APPEND to the clipboard, without
    erasing the information already in the clipboard. If the present
    contents of the common clipboard are not in TEXT format (i.e. HEX
    format), you will not be able to append the text, and you will be told
    this.

  * The "replace" string in the Search/Replace function can now be empty,
    allowing you to replace any string that you find with nothing,
    effectively deleting the text.

  * Deleting the last line of a text file, when that line did not end with
    a CR/LF combination, would crash the editor when you tried to
    leave/save.

  * Deleting the last line (ALT-D) no longer moves the cursor up one line.
    This prevents you from deleting too many lines, simply because ALT-D
    repeated too fast.

  * Added cursor placement and text scrolling using the mouse.

  * If you started a new file, some important variables would not be set
    properly, and you would not be informed that a new file was being
    started (as it use to do).

  * Blank lines couldn't be tagged in certain circumstances.

  * Once again, if there was not a 64COPY.EXT associations file, doing a
    CTRL-F4 (Edit Extensions file) would not work. The Text Editor would be
    called up, and would promptly close.

  * Redesigned the ASCII Chart window. If you double-click on the character
    you want, it will be inserted into the document. The ASCII chart will
    then come up again. If you don't want it anymore, just cancel it. The
    ASCII range you have displayed (000-127 or 128-255) will be remembered,
    along with which ASCII character you were on, for the next time you use
    it.

  * Pasted HEX data will now include a starting address and appended ASCII
    text...

   0000: 44 57 42 20 39 20 0D 53 55 50 45 52 20 44 4F 53   DWBú9úSUPERúDOS

  * The KEYPADMINUS key was appending to the clipboard when it should have
    been replacing the clipboard contents. ALT-KEYPADMINUS is reserved for
    appending to the clipboard.


* Changes to the Macro function:

  * A word of warning... DO NOT RECORD ANY MACROS WITH ANY MOUSE INVOLVED.
    It will not cause any *problems*, but simply holding down the mouse
    while recording will generate ~100 macro steps/second. This is an
    unavoidable side-effect of the new mouse routines, and it CANNOT be
    fixed or changed.

  * Added a version number check to the .MAC file. If the version in the
    MAC file is wrong for the program, the file will be ignored. 

  * Increased macro key-step count to 200 (from 175).

  * Added in future expansion of mouse movement/clicks into macros.

  * Removed the F9 "Play Macro" key and moved the function to the new
    CTRL-F9 all-encompassing Macro function. *All* macro functions now run
    from there. This allows for the use of the F9 key for the pull-down
    menus (I knew this would happen eventually!)

  * When recording a new macro, you are no longer *forced* to enter a name.
    You can enter it later. All names, if none entered, will default to the
    number of the macro, i.e. "Macro 1".

  * Pressing ESC during Macro recording will no longer stop the recording.
    The only way to stop recording is to call up the Macro window and
    specify the F12 "Stop Recording" key. That key sequence will not be
    recorded.

  * Error windows that come up during a Macro recording will no longer stop
    the recording. An error during *playback* will stop execution, along
    with pressing ESC during *playback* will still stop the execution.

  * The menu bar now displays the macro number and keystroke count of the
    macro being recorded or played back. This way, you can see when you
    might be reaching the keystroke limit of the present macro.

  * Macro Record chaining is a little different. If you want to record from
    one macro to another, record the macro you want, call up the Macro
    window, move to the new macro you want to record, and press F8 (Record)
    again. This will start recording at the new macro number, and chain the
    previous one to the new one. If you point the macro to itself, you will
    start recording overtop of what you have already recorded.

  * Macro repeating is a little different as well. This is where you want
    to record a macro, and have it *loop* back to itself or another macro.
    Record the macro(s) you want, call up the Macro window, move to the
    macro you want to start repeating from and press F9. This will point
    the present macro to the new one you specify, and stop the recording.
    If it points to itself, then that macro will loop.

  * In RECORD mode, the F1 (Change macro name), DEL (Delete macro) and F5
    (Set Loop) keys are not allowed, and are removed from the list of
    active keys in the Fkey bar. As soon as RECORD mode is off, the keys
    are active, and will be shown in the Fkey bar.

  * Added AUTO-CHAIN macros. This allows you to start recording at macro 1,
    and when you reach the end of that macro, the program will
    automatically point that macro to the next one, and start recording at
    the next macro. When the last macro (5) is reached, recording will stop
    like normal.

  * Each macro is displayed with the number of keys that have been
    recorded, so at least you know if there is something defined.

  * Added Macro Execution Speed. With this, you can control the speed of
    the macro playback, from fastest (no delay between steps), medium
    (average speed) and slow (long delay between steps).

  * Added in display of chained macros. If one macro is chained (looped) to
    another, this will be displayed right after the step count. i.e. "170
    steps, jump to 3" would mean the macro is 170 steps (or keys), and when
    it finishes, it jumps to macro 3, and continues.

  * Added in Set Macro Loop (F5). This allows you to set/unset a loop on a
    single macro, to make it auto-repeat.


* Changes to the Configuration screen:

  * Completely re-wrote the configuration window. I removed the "Advanced
    Configuration" menu item, and grouped what I consider to be the common
    buttons/toggles together. ALT-F6 now brings up a selection list of all
    the configurable areas, like that below:

      * Editors/Viewers
      * Mouse/Keyboard
      * Visual Options
      * Emulator Options
      * Macros
      * Screen Saver
      * Miscellaneous

  * Changed the configuration option under "Visual Options" from "24 hour
    mode" to "24 hour time". This option will now also change the file
    times displayed in the panels to 24 hour mode, along with the clock
    display.

  * Added a "Recalc Delay" button to the Miscellaneous window, to
    re-calculate the internal delay value the program needs for specific
    functions.

  * Removed all the annoying warning messages from the Configuration
    window

  * Added "24 hour clock" to the Visual area, to display the time in
    military (0-23 hour) mode.

  * The following options have been moved to the menus...

     * Clock on/off
     * Tall cursor
     * Panel file filter options (each panel now has its own)

  * Added a new Screen Saver option "Detect mouse movement". It allows you
    to disable the mouse movement detection so that an accidental nudge of
    the mouse will not stop bring you out of the saver.

  * Added "Left-handed mouse" and "Mouse click speed" to the mouse config
    area.

  * Added new options for Macro recording and playback...

     * AutoChain Macros - to record one macro spanning several physical
       macros.

     * Macro playback speed - to adjust the speed that macros get
       executed.

  * Added option "ESC turns panels on/off" to the Miscellaneous page. This
    will enable/disable the toggling of the panels on or off by pressing
    the ESC key.

  * Added option "CheckD/T/Zip repair", settable to "scan only" and
    "scan/query". If you set it for "scan only" you can scan D64's, T64's
    and ZipCode files very fast, simply getting a dump of what is found, no
    questions asked. If you select "scan/query", you will be asked all the
    normal questions when a problem is found.

  * Removed "ASK" from the option for "Case sensitive searches" under
    EDITORS/VIEWERS. Instead, I put a button saying "[ ] Case sensitive
    search" on each of the dialog boxes where this occurred. This includes
    the File Viewer, HEX editor, D64 HEX Editor and Text Editor, both find
    and find/replace.

  * Added button "Restore Defaults" to the main window. If you are not sure
    about certain settings, just click on this button to default *all* of
    the configuration settings. Clicking on OK after this will make the new
    settings take effect.

  * Added in "Extended D64" options to the Emulator page. Here you can
    select if you want to create 40 track images, what type of DOS (Speed
    DOS or Dolphin DOS), and if error bytes should be automatically
    appended. The error byte info can be selected independantly of the 40
    track support.

  * Added "Clear deleted D64 files" to the Emulator page. With this
    enabled, any files you delete from a D64/X64 file will be completely
    zero'd out, making recovery possibly, but allowing for better
    compression if you plan to store the file.

  * Added "Auto-indent" to the Editors/Viewers page. This setting is for
    when you hit return in the Text Editor, if you want the cursor to jump
    to where the line starts on the previous line. It will also indent the
    cursor if you type a '}' while editing a C file. (This setting was
    previously always on, not user-settable).

  * Added "Remove menubar when panels off" to the Unusual settings area.
    With this enables, turning off both panels (by ESC, CTRL-O, CTRL-F1/F2)
    will remove the menu bar at the top of the screen as well. It will also
    add the string "64COPY" to the prompt display, letting you know you are
    still in 64COPY.

  * Added under the Screen Saver window the ability to disable any saver
    module and adjust the time before switching modules.

  * Added *many* new options.

  * Removed the "Line Width" from the Editor/Viewer page. It is now on the
    Text Editor configuration window, only available in the editor.

  * Added option "INSERT moves cursor down" to the Miscellaneous page. This
    will disable the downward movement of the hilite bar when tagging files
    with the INSERT key.

  * Added 1 new clock option "Display date" to the Visual page, allowing
    you to remove the date portion of the menu-bar clock display.

  * Added the OPTIONS menu toggles to the Visual page.

  * Added new option "Show time est. in DOS copies" to the Miscellaneous
    page. With this, you can remove the "Est: 00:00:00" display in the
    copy/move window.


* Changes to the Color Configuration window:

  * Completely rewrote the color subsystem. Since I now have 150 colors
    defined (75 color, 75 b/w), I grouped the colors together into common
    groups, and now you can edit them from there. Select the group you want
    and hit return to display the colors.

      * File display panels
      * Main dialog windows
      * Confirmation windows
      * Error windows
      * Function windows
      * Pull-down menus
      * Help window
      * Miscellaneous

  * Changed the names of some of the Fkeys in the Color Configuration
    window to make more sense about what they do.

  * Added ALT-F5 (Decrement forground color) and ALT-F6 (Decrement
    background color)

  * Added a confirmation asking about using the new colors when exiting.

  * Colors which I thought should be together will have a number beside
    them, indicating which group they belong to (in that window). If you
    adjust the colors, and have "Color Synchronize" on, then they will all
    change at the same time.

  * Added in Color Synchronization (F11), where when you adjust the
    background colors, all the background colors that group will be kept
    the same. It's default is always "on".

  * If you set a color so as the text is invisible (same foreground and
    background color), you will be asked if this is what you want when you
    exit the edit screen.

  * Any new colors that I add will be automatically merged into the
    existing .CLR file.

  * Removed the "color" name display

  * Added buttons for "Restore Colors" and "Undo Changes"

  * Added F3 (Load Colors) and F4 (Save Colors). Now you can save backup
    copies of new color schemes, and load them later.


* Changes to the BAM editor:

  * Added in BAM Edit to the main Fkeys on SHIFT-F11. Now, instead of
    having to go into the D64 Editor, or even go into the D64 image, you
    can edit just by positioning the cursor over the filename in the
    panel.

  * Added in checking/warning for bad BAM's (bad "blocks free" count).

  * Added filename display into the BAM editor (under the "Blocks Free")

  * Added in "Set User Blocks" in the BAM Editor (F2)

  * In 25 line mode the Fkey bar is no longer visible, but help is still
    available on F1. This way, I can still include the title bar and a
    header line.

  * Added F3, a multi-purpose key to Set, Clear or Toggle the BAM bits of a
    whole track.

  * Changed the display from using "+" and "-" to using "ú" and "*", to
    better see the difference between free and used sectors. I also
    included a legend at the bottom of the display describing these
    symbols.

  * You could press SHIFT-F11 in *any* archive file (LNX, T64), and attempt
    to edit the BAM (even though they don't have one)... I thought I had
    fixed this a while ago!


* Changes to the clock display:

  * Shrunk down the clock display (removed the year portion), and fixed the
    color problem if you turned off the clock when the clock color was
    different from the top menu.

  * The clock was not updated when exiting certain full-screen functions.
    The time from when you entered the function would be displayed
    instead.

  * You can now display the clock in "24 hour" mode (military/European
    time). The option is under the General Config, visual area.


* Changes to the Hex Editor

  * VERY SERIOUS: If you made any edits, then did any of following: HOME,
    END, F11, F5 or F6, then saved the changes, the file would get
    corrupted and/or shortened.

  * Files edited in the HEX editor were not having their date/times
    modified, due to the way I was opening the files (in shared access
    mode).

  * You should be able to now *display* almost any file you need to (except
    those opened in single-access mode). I think I finally figured out the
    permissions needed for SHARED file access.

  * Column titles and HEX address display are now in the proper TITLE
    color.

  * Added cursor address display. Now you can see what address you are at.

  * Added cursor placement and scrolling. You can click in either the HEX
    data or the ASCII data to position the cursor.

  * When clicking in the close-window button, both the HEX editor window
    and then the panel windows would be removed.

  * HEX search (F6) would allow you to enter just spaces as search
    parameters, without HEX values.

  * Set the "Show Blanks" to be on by default.

  * The cursor is now moved to the location of the found ASCII/HEX, instead
    of staying at the top of the screen.

  * When searching, the search starts from where the *cursor* is located,
    not from where the search ended last.

  * Pasting a clipboard block, so that the paste area would exceed the end
    of the file, would crash the program.

  * Entering a HEX number in the last position of the file would result in
    the last digit of the number not being visually changed until you moved
    the cursor.

  * Display corruption would happen if doing a search on a file smaller
    than 16kbytes would result in a "search string not found", and you then
    attempted to scroll the display.


* Some changes to the Disassembler:

  * Added the option to add labels of common ROM & I/O addresses in the
    disassembly output as a button on the F2 "Disassemble to File". These
    labels take the place of the address in the disassembly code.

  * Changed the ".ORG =" to "* =", which is what most assemblers use for
    "set code origin". Improved the HELP topic.

  * Sped up the "Save to file" output.


* Major changes to the LNX archive handling:

  * I now allow adding to and deleting from any LNX archive. This means
    that LNX is now fully supported.

  * Re-wrote a major portion of the code handling LNX files. Now the LNX
    files I create don't have extra zero's in the numbers for the directory
    block/remainder entries.

  * You can now open empty LNX files (no entries). The program use to
    complain saying "Not a LYNX file."

  * I now display the "label" (Creator/LNX version) of a LNX file.


* Added ARK and LBR format read-only convert support. You cannot create,
  modify, delete or CheckARK/LBR these files, but you can copy/convert from
  them. They behave just like any other archive file in you simply hit
  return on them to enter them. This resulted in some other changes to the
  display of archive files:

  * Changed panel display for T64/LNX/ARK/LBR to display write-protected
    files (which ARK files can have).

  * The write-protect ("<") flag on D64/X64/ARK files are kept when copying
    to other D64/X64 images. No other archive type supports the
    write-protect (locked) flag anyways.

  * The ".." file in D64/X64 images no longer displays a "0" size. All
    other archive files already don't display the size of the up-dir entry.


* Some changes to the CheckXXX routines:

  * Added a status line to the display window. It shows filename, log
    status and scan status.

  * Added option Configuration/CheckXXX page to skip the CheckD64 "File
    xlinked with directory" check. This will allow you to skip over
    directory separator files in a disk check.

  * You no longer have to enter an emulator file to check it. You can
    select a group of files (T64, D64 and ZipCode) and check them all at
    once.

  * Combined the Log options for T64/D64/ZipCode into one again. I no
    longer have the "ASK" option as the option now appears in the initial
    dialog box. The config option defaults to "no" instead of ask.

  * Removed the time stamp from the log file output as it proved to be
    unreliable.

  * Added clearing (zeroing) of D64 file "slack space" (the unused area of
    the last sector of a file). The option is under Configuration, the
    CheckXXX page called "Clear file slack space". If *any* errors are
    detected during the file scan, or the file is a REL, this function will
    be skipped.

    It is also not set on by default, as if an error happens, it could
    possibly erase file information, so use with caution!

  * If you are not inside the D64 when CheckD64 is run, you will not be
    given the opporunity to run the "extended tests" (recover deleted
    files, lost chains, clear sectors). For these tests to be run, you must
    be in the D64, and have the option enabled in the configuration.

  * The Fkey assignment for ALT-F3 (CheckXXX) wasn't being updated when you
    switched from window to window, and would become set to simply
    "CheckFile" most of the time.

  * Moved all CheckXXX options from the Emulator page to a new
    CheckD64/T64/Zip page under the Configuration.


* Some changes to the CheckZip code:

  * I was not checking up to the full track range for the file. If the file
    had track range of 17-25, it would only check up to track 24.

  * If the ZipCode file had an extension (like StarZip's ".Z64"), the file
    could not be opened for checking.

  * I now report when a track is out of range for the file being checked.
    If the range is only 9-16, then any track not conforming to that range
    will be reported.


* Changes to the command-line HISTORY handling:

  * The uparrow/downarrow (when panels off) history display on the
    command-line was out of sync with where the history index was in the
    history window.

  * When exiting the HISTORY window, the history index would be set back
    the last command entered.

  * Hitting CTRL-ENTER will copy the selected entry onto the command line,
    but will not execute it.


* Changes to the Viewer:

  * If you edited and saved a file in the HEX editor, then called up the
    Viewer, you would be asked if you wanted to "Save the changes to the
    previous block?" by mistake. I was not clearing out the "saved" flag
    after exiting the HEX editor.

  * When viewing a text file in RAW mode in the File Viewer will now not
    translate the TAB into "úúú" and the CR/LF into "", but are instead
    displayed as single symbols. Only in TEXT mode will the translation be
    done.

  * Display corruption would happen if doing a search on a file smaller
    than 16kbytes would result in a "search string not found", and you then
    attempted to scroll the display.


* Added most of the keys that NC/SC/VC define for cursor movement and
  shortcuts on the command-line. Also, some changes were made:

  * CTRL-B - remove the Function key bar
  * CTRL-H - delete character (same as backspace)
  * CTRL-Y - delete command line (same as ESC)
  * CTRL-S - move cursor left (same as left arrow)
  * CTRL-D - move cursor right (same as right arrow)
  * CTRL-F - jump to next word to the right (same as CTRL-RIGHTARROW)
  * CTRL-G - delete character under cursor (same as DELETE)
  * CTRL-W - delete word to left of cursor (same as CTRL-BACKSPACE)
  * CTRL-K - delete to end of line
  * CTRL-T - delete word to right of cursor
  * CTRL-I - append present filename to command line (instead of panel
             switch, like TAB)
  * CTRL-[ - append left panel drive/path
  * CTRL-] - append right panel drive/path
  * CTRL-ENTER - Search HISTORY for command-line match (instead of
                 appending the filename to the command-line)


* Holding down the SHIFT and CTRL keys would result in the wrong FKEY bar
  being displayed. The normal Fkey bar would be seen, rather than the CTRL
  bar, as it should have been.


* Removed CTRL-F12/ALT-F12 (create T64/X64) and moved them to the new F12
  "Create Archive File". From there you now select the archive filetype you
  want to create. This way I can add the creation of more archive types
  much more easily (like LNX).


* I have extensively modified the way I handle *all* BAM operations (set
  bam bit, clear bam bit, test bam bit, toggle, etc), and this change has
  affected *all* operations relating to D64's. This includes CheckD64,
  Convert, Delete, etc. Be forewarned I may have made some subtle mistakes.


* Increased the number of internal system colors to 75 (from 20). This
  should provide enough colors for future expansion. This means the old
  .CLR (used as a color backup) and the .INI files are no longer valid.
  What I have done is re-wrote the entire color sub-system, defining a
  standard set of colors for each function (menus, panels, message windows,
  confirmation windows, error windows, function windows, and
  miscellaneous), which can be altered. This separates the main panel
  colors from all other functions.


* Added detection of BAM "Blocks free" inconsistencies when copying into a
  D64. If one is detected, you will be warned, and asked if you want to
  continue with the copy/move. If a disk image is detected with this
  problem, it is a good idea *not* to continue as you may overwrite sectors
  with information. Run CheckDisk to see what is wrong.


* Commands executed from the command-line are no longer converted to upper
  case. This includes commands retrieved from the .EXT file as well. Now,
  if you have to pass any varying-case options to a program (i.e. pkzip's
  "-rP"), you can do so.


* Changed the look and position of the ALT-filename search box. With the
  introduction of the full/short panels, and info box on/off, it would no
  longer work the old way.


* The File Info area was not being updated when you used the ALT keys to
  find a file name in a panel.


* Edit Extension File only uses the internal editor now, not what the
  Configuration window had set, i.e. internal/external editors.


* Changed all the search functions (Viewer, Editor, D64 Editor) so that
  using F5 repeatedly (or F6 where applicable) will not remove the "String
  not found" error window when it comes up.


* If there is no .EXT file, then when CTRL-F4 (Edit Extension File) is hit,
  the EDITOR will start a new file with that name.


* Removed the CTRL-C "emergency-quit" checking. It wasn't working!


* The CheckZipCode routine now only works on *one* ZipCode section at a
  time. If you want to check a full set of four ZipCode files, you will
  have to do them one at a time. This should make it easier to make quick
  changes and check one file, rather than having to wade through the log
  file output of a four-file check.


* Cancelling a file copy into D64 images no longer leaves open t/s chains,
  messing up future copies.


* Keypad +/- (Tag all) for the main panels will now accept multiple file
  patterns... so now you can enter "*.txt *.doc *.??l" to tag/untag
  multiple groups of files. The string entered is no longer converted to
  upper case.


* Renaming a file inside a P00 file, where the resulting DOS filename did
  not change, would fail with a "File exists" error.


* History window will no longer change width when items are removed from
  it.


* If for some reason the program cannot find any room internally for a new
  window (on my window stack), then the program will quit, and tell you
  this. If this happens, I need to know this, as it means I am not
  destroying all the windows when they should be, something which should
  *never* happen!


* If you get the "Convert ZipCode/D64" window, and you don't want to do
  this, say "No", and you will be brought into the regular Convert window.
  Pressing ESC will now cancel the entire operation.


* If you get the "Copy xxx into the D64/T64", then by selecting "no", you
  will now drop into the regular copy/move dialog boxes. Selecting "cancel"
  (or pressing ESC) will cancel the entire operation.


* Entering your own filename when converting into a LNX file would fail. If
  you went with the default filename, everything worked.


* Program would abend if the BASIC Unlister encountered a quote mode
  graphics token of 160 ($A0).


* Sped up the "Save to file" output of the BASIC Unlister.


* Re-wrote the section in the MANUAL.TXT dealing with the command-line
  switches, stressing the need to use the "/m" (monochrome) switch when
  running 64COPY on a portable.


* When you change the state of the "Auto-save settings" in the General
  Configuration window from checked to unchecked, the settings will be
  saved immediately upon exiting the config window so that the INI is
  updated.


* Updated the FORMATS.TXT file to include the latest revision of the X64
  specification (version 1.02), a section on explanations of common
  Commodore/computer terms and acronyms, LBR format, ARC format and C64
  BITMAP formats. I also broke up the FORMATS.TXT document into separate
  files, each one a specific format. This should make it easier for people
  to download/view.


* Changed the header used to create X64 files to conform to the new v1.02
  X64 standard.


* You can now use the CURSOR DOWN and CURSOR UP keys to navigate the
  Configuration window, instead of the just the TAB/SHIFT-TAB keys.


* The Fkey display will only show what fkeys are applicable for a given
  function. This way, you won't be trying to use Fkeys which are defined
  for the main panels in a sub-function (like F1 for help, where it doesn't
  yet exist)


* Hitting return on non-archive files, which were "active OS files" would
  result in the error message "Can't open file", which you should have
  never seen.


* Moved User-menu Edit command to F2 (from F1), making room for F1 Help in
  the future.


* LNX/T64/P00 panel displays now show filesize in blocks, rather than
  bytes.


* Added in Panel Setup to both the Left and Right menus. Here you can
  select the style of the panel you want to see. "Type 1" is the one you
  are use to, "Type 2" is an alternate design I have in place. You can also
  remove the display of the status and "disk free" lines.


* Added option "Panel visible on startup" to the Panel Setup menu item.
  This will override the panel on/off setting which is saved when you quit.
  This way, if you quit with the panels not visible, with this option set,
  the panels will come up visible again.


* Added a file pattern to the Filter command (on the menus). This allows
  you to *only* display the files that match the pattern you specify. No
  pattern means display all files, but directories will always be
  displayed.


* Added some new options to the "Filter" command under the Left & Right
  menus. These are "Show all files", "Show only executables", which
  displays only the EXE/COM/BAT's, and "Show only image files", which only
  displays the emulator files that I support.


* Moved the calculation of the PAUSE value to when the program first gets
  loaded. It will calculate the value only if the INI doesn't exist, and
  store it in the INI, so it won't need to be re-calculated.


* Added CRC integrity checking to all the external support files (.CLR,
  .INI, .MNU, .MAC). The macro file was already using a weaker checksum,
  but I removed this in favor of a much stronger CRC check. If any of the
  files are corrupted, you will be notified when the program starts.


* Any new colors I add later on will now be merged automatically into the
  .CLR file. There should be no need for me to change the version of the
  CLR file when I make color changes (unless I re-structure the file
  internally or increase the number of system colors past the present 75).


* Fixed a bug in the History routine, where commands were not always being
  stored, as they should have been.


* Errors found during the CheckD64 "Checking files" scan were not being
  updated until a sector boundary was crossed. Updates would be lost if you
  cancelled the scan/repair before the track/sector changed.


* I've disabled (I hope!) the PRINT-SCREEN key from functioning when inside
  the program. If shelled, it should be as normal.


* Added ability to enter ALT-numpad characters when in a text input area.
  So, if your are at the 64COPY command-line, or are waiting to enter a
  filename in a dialog box, you can enter ALT-1,2 to enter a "" character.


* You can once again switch the "Change Drive" window to the opposite panel
  by typing the ALT-F1/ALT-F2 when in the ALT-F1/ALT-F2 "Change Drive"
  window. I had removed this feature some time ago.


* If the Convert routine called for a new directory entry inside of a X/D64
  and a new sector had to be allocated in the directory, then the copy/move
  failed (e.g. disk full), the BAM would not show the newly allocated block
  as allocated. CheckDisk at this point would show an error (BAM Map
  mismatch).


* Conversion of files from D/X64's, with illegal T/S links (specifically
  track=0, sector<2) would not get converted properly. It was taken for an
  end-of-file, but what was getting written to the destination was
  incorrect (too long), and no error was being reported.


* Added the "[ ] Auto-convert filenames" button to the Convert and PET-TEXT
  conversion windows. This is the same setting that is available in the
  configuration window under "Emulator Conversion". If the option is not
  on, you can turn it on (temporarily) from here so that you don't have to
  go through the task of hitting return on every file being converted or
  translated, rather than having to go to the Config window first.


* PC64 (P00) files can now be mass tagged and converted, without having to
  do each one separately.


* Doing a Convert with delete, and the destination file (D64) ended up
  full, the source file would get deleted by mistake.


* Files recovered in the CheckD64 routine (not lost chains) would have
  their filename case flipped incorrectly.


* When converting ZipCode files back to D64's, you can specify to create an
  X64 file instead by clicking on the button "[ ] Create X64 file" in the
  dialog box where you enter the name of the target archive. If the ZipCode
  is a 5-file version (40 track), then X64 is an invalid option, and you
  will be overridden.


* Added ability to copy "separator" files in/out of most archive files. A
  separator file is usually of zero length, consists of dashes or graphical
  characters ("----------------"), and appears to reside on the directory
  track if its on a D64. Separators in LNX/ARK have a zero length only.
  T64's cannot have separator files as their stucture doesn't support them.


* Changed the way I calculate time lengths in the screen saver (and
  virtually everywhere else). On some systems my previous method would
  immediately enable the saver after the program started, and would likely
  result in incorrect times that each module would run and switch. The new
  method is *very* accurate.


* Added "Toggle Allocation" on ALT-F1 to the D64 HEX Editor, which will
  flip the BAM allocation bit, thus freeing or allocating the sector,
  without having to go into the BAM editor.


* Added "Trace Chain" command to the D64 Disk Editor on ALT-F7. With this,
  you can automatically follow a file chain to the last sector. Circular
  references (endless loops) are detected.


* Changed the main SEARCH (ALT F7) window to include a list of available
  drives, instead of asking to search "This drive" or "All drives". You can
  now select from the available disks, and what you select will be saved in
  the INI for future use. Floppy drives are not selected by default, but
  you can change this.


* File Search would never search the disk you were on when the search was
  started, even if it was the only one selected.


* Changed the method that most of the internal editors use to copy info
  into the common clipboard. It would sometimes cause crashes while copying
  or appending to the clipboard, with the TEXT editor being the worst
  culprit. These are now limit checks in place so that the clipboard size
  can't get too large.


* Added "Format Image" to the COMMANDS menu. When inside of a
  D64/X64/T64/LNX, you can use this to format the image so that it is like
  new, instead of having to create a new one. When you format a D64, you
  can specify to use the original 1541 "4B 01" sector pattern, rather than
  filling them with zero's.


* Added "File Information" to the FILES menu, just under the "File
  Attributes" entry (CTRL-N). This returns a small amount of information
  like name, type, size (in bytes/blocks), and any special info if the file
  is a D/X64.


* Added "!!!" filetype to the Change Attributes for D64's. Re-wrote the way
  I change the attributes (the old way sucked!)


* Rearranged the info header-bar layout of the full-screen functions. They
  all now follow a common layout of filename first, then display options,
  then location (%, trk/sec) into the file.


* Added ability to group-tag "separators" in archive files. The new option
  for this is under FILTER for either panel and is default off.


* On slow machines (those under a 486/33 without any disk caching), some
  operations (i.e. formatting a D64 file) would appear not to do anything
  for a few seconds, since the disk I/O was taking so long. You will now
  see a message box before the process appears so you know what is
  happening, rather than after it is done, and it will not go away until
  the procedure is finished.


* Added support for an evironment variable. Do a "SET 64COPY=pathname" in
  the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and that will be the path that 64COPY will look
  for all of its support files. If you do not set it, then 64COPY will
  still look in its starting directory.
