
Summary of changes from 3.10 beta 2 to 3.10 beta 3
--------------------------------------------------

* Changes to the Convert routine:
  - Added create-only ARK support into the Convert routine. You can create
    them (and copy out of them), but you can't add to or delete from them.
  - Added full REL file support. You can copy them out of D64, ARK, LNX,
    ARC/SDA and R00 (PC64) files, and copy into D64/X64, LNX, R00 and ARK.
    They can be copied into T64's and DOS binaries, but they cease to be
    REL files.
  - If converting a ZipCode to a D64 failed, a partially created D64 file
    would be left.
  - The filetype would get mangled (set to FRZ) when copying T64 files into
    other T64 files.


* Changes to Config/Screen Saver window:
  - Re-designed the config window, moving the "Test Savers" button and
    adding a "Config" button.
  - Arranged the list of savers into a user-selectable list. Now you select
    the specific saver you want to work with and either press Test or
    Config.
  - The checkboxes beside the saver names still exist, to enable/disable
    their execution.
  - Added extra configuration options to all the screen savers (under the
    config button).
  - When the SNAKE GAME ran out of snakes, they would not always
    regenerate.


* Changes to the MACRO control center (CTRL-F9):
  - Added new buttons for Play, Record and Delete.
  - Any Fkeys that are not available in a particular mode are not shown.
  - Added two of the Config option switches "Auto-chain recording" and
    "Auto-repeat playback".


* Changes to the Text Editor:
  - The tagging (F7/F8) in the Text Editor has been improved/fixed.
  - Added "delete word right" (CTRL-T), "delete word left" (CTRL-BACKSPACE)
    and "delete to end of line" (CTRL-K)
  - Added in a Norton Editor mode switch "Use Norton Editor keys". It
    emulates *most* of the operations of Norton Edit (like live tagging on
    F3), but the screen colors are not the same, and there are some subtle
    differences.


* Added a new switch to the Config/Emulator page called "Use long C64 dest.
  names" which allows you to create long DOS names from long C64 names.
  i.e. If you have a filename "forb. forest ii", the converting to a DOS
  binary with this switch on, the resulting filename will be
  "forb._forest_ii.ext". Notice the '.' characters of C64 names will be
  retained. When not running an LFN os, make sure you don't enable this
  switch.

  This switch is also under program control, but only when the program is
  first executed. Once the program is running, you can change the switch
  manually. If 64COPY detects you are running under a long filename OS
  (Win95), then this will be turned on. If you're running under DOS only,
  this will be turned off. You can still change the switch during normal
  program operations, but be aware that the program *might* change it for
  you.


* Removed a long-time (annoying!) bug in the screen saver. If you hit an
  "extended" key (like an Fkey or an ALT-key) to bring back the panel
  display when any screen saver is running, the keystroke would not be
  fully taken out of the keyboard buffer, making the mouse buttons
  inoperative and causing *lots* of other problems.


* Turning the panels on/off (using ESC) enough times with the titlebar
  visible would eventually cause an "Internal error: no more windows
  available".


* You can now cancel the changes made in the FILTER menu item, PANEL SETUP
  menu item, Color Configuration and Program Configuration windows by
  clicking the CANCEL button, or hitting ESC on the keyboard. Clicking on
  the OK button will go ahead with the changes.


* Increased the user-settable options to 200, to make room for individual
  screen saver configuration (and more).


* When the clock changed from 12:59 to 1:00, the leading "1" from the "12"
  would remain, making the time appear to say "11:xx" instead of "1:xx".


* The cursor was accidentally being left activated when calling some
  functions from the menus, but only when the menus were brought up using
  the mouse, not F9.


* The "Button Controller" can now handle confirmation buttons "OK/CANCEL"
  with an active key other than the first key of the button name (i.e.
  instead of a "Configure" button using the 'C' key, I can send it in as
  "conFigure", with the 'F' being the active key). Up until now I could not
  use buttons starting with the 'C' key, since that key is always reserved
  for "Cancel", whether its a visible button or not.


* Greatly improved the randomness of the random number generator.


* Added an extra line to the info header line of the File Viewer, to allow
  for very long filenames.


* Changes to many entries in the FORMATS.TXT doc (esp. dealing with REL
  file support in various file types)


* ARK files would not display file sizes over 256 blocks properly, and
  under some circumstances you could not extract from them properly.


* Fixed some cursor movement and highlighting bugs in the D64 HEX Editor.


* Formatting a D64 image would cause the BAM for track 18 to be incorrect
  (18/0 and 18/1 would not be allocated for the BAM and directory)


* The HEX Editor now displays the ASCII code (hex and decimal) of the
  character you are on.


* ZipCode's being displayed in the left panel no longer claim to have error
  bytes attached (35/E)


* Compare can now compare two files in the same panel.
