
Summary of changes from 3.10 beta 1 to 3.10 beta 2
--------------------------------------------------

* Added in support for ARC and SDA files. They work just like ARK and LBR
  in that they are read-only, but all you do is hit return on them to
  display the contents. The displayed size (in blocks) is the compressed
  size, so be aware that the resultant file will be larger.


* Added in a new PANEL type for compressed ARC/SDA files (and, hopefully,
  the future inclusion of LHA/LZH). By default the compression type for
  each file is shown.

  This addition also facilitated the changing of many of the panel
  associated routines, and the Panel Editor, so be on guard for bugs!


* Added in the *direct* displaying of ZipCode files. Now, when you hit
  return on *any* part of a ZipCode file, the panel will display the files
  contained, just like a D64 file, except they are read-only, no deleting,
  renaming, etc. This saves the step of Converting them to D64 first, just
  to extract files from them. The only limitation is they must be DOS files
  for this to work, and not in another archive (like LNX/ARK/T64).


* Added a simple file compare function under the COMMANDS menu. It compares
  files across the panels, so you can have a single file tagged in either
  panel to compare, or simply have the hilite bars on the each of the files
  you want to compare. The differences will be shown in the resulting
  window.


* Changes to the Convert routine:

  * Added in copying out of SDA and ARC files.

  * Added extracting files directly from ZipCode files

  * When Converting files, the filetypes were usually being lost. Most of
    the time, it went back to PRG.

  * When cancelling a "copy into xxx archive" to do a Convert instead, the
    destination filename was incorrect.

  * When Converting to a new type, and you have more than one file
    selected, the destination filename will be based on the original source
    filename, and not the first tagged name.

  * You should now be able to convert ZipCode files to D64's from within
    ARK and LBR archives.


* Some changes to the BIG CLOCK screen saver:
  * Time now displayed with seconds
  * The colons flash every second
  * It switches screen position when the seconds reach 00 or 30.


* Added a new option to the Visual page of the Configuration called "% of
  screen". This allows you to change the panel height to a percentage of
  the screen when the "full screen" option is disabled.


* If the contents of a floppy is being displayed in a panel, there is no
  longer an annoying delay removing the panels when executing a command
  line operation.


* The clock will no longer display A:00 when the panels come back up, if
  displaying a floppy.


* Greatly improved the content of SDA and ARC topics in the FORMATS.TXT
  document.


* The "Left hand mouse" option under Configuration/Keyboard now works
  correctly.


* More HELP additions/changes and minor visual things corrected.


* Log files created when checking ZipCode's now have the "!" component of
  the filename replaced with a "_". This has been done to prevent file type
  auto-detection problems when hitting return on them. They will appear to
  be ZipCode files, and since they are not an error window will result.


* Scroll-bar indicator placement now works when clicking in it with the
  mouse.

Summary of changes from 3.00 beta 10 to 3.10 beta 1
---------------------------------------------------

* Yes folks, I've changed the version number from 3.00 to 3.10 as the
  changes I've made this time around warrant it. With the addition of Win95
  long filename support (and the sheer amount of code changes necessary for
  this), literally every function in the program had to be changed.

  All of the file I/O (open, close, read, get, put, write, seek, etc) had
  to be re-written to handle both short (DOS) and long (Win95) filenames.
  With these changes comes bugs, and there's bound to be plenty. There's
  more that had to be written (or re-written usually), but suffice it to
  say that most all of the file operations are new and not rigorously
  tested.

  ***                                          ***
  *** Please, use this first release with care ***
  ***                                          ***

  Changes to look for regarding long filenames:

  * LFN's are not displayed in the panel listing, this has not changed. If
    you cursor onto an LFN, the long name will get displayed in the status
    line above "disk free" at the bottom of the panel.

  * Whenever a long filename is being displayed, and it is too big to fit
    into the space given, it will be truncated and a "" will be tacked
    onto the end, meaning "more filename exists than you see".

  * Changed the info bar displays for nearly all the full-screen functions
    (Text Editor, File Viewer, HEX Editor, emulator functions, etc) so long
    names are displayed as best I could given the space limitations.

  * Added button "Use long filenames" to the Config/Miscallaneous page to
    enable/disable useage of Windows long filenames.

  * Added button "Display long filename" to the PANEL config window. With
    this you can change the file status line from name/ext/size/date/time
    to displaying most of the long filename. If the name is only a short,
    then that is all that will be displayed.

  * When copying/moving LFN's, *all* the Win95 attributes (creation,
    access, update) are retained.


* Major changes to the LNX handling code:

  * A *serious* bug was found that would corrupt an LNX file. If you had
    two LNX files open in opposite panels, and you switched (tabbed)
    between them while doing some copying/deleting, one or both of the
    LNX's could become corrupt if any more copying was done.

  * If you tried to copy more than 4 files into a newly-created (0 entries)
    LNX, the resulting LNX file would be created incorrectly.

  * The code to read and display LNX archives is now much more forgiving
    with respect to file header layout differences. There do exist some LNX
    archives which are missing spaces between certain header elements, and
    the old code would treat these files as corrupt.

  * The panel display for LNX's now shows the # of entries used and an
    approximate # of entries available before the directory needs to be
    expanded.

  * You can now specify the starting directory block size of LNX's in the
    F12 Create Archive (up to 99 blocks, or approx. 807-825 files).

  * The unlynx code could not calculate the proper block size of a file if
    it was greater than 65535 bytes.


* Major changes to the Button Controller

  * A window can now have multiple "hilite bars", allowing you to select
    items from a list, check selection boxes, and select a confirmation
    button (OK/CANCEL), while maintaining all the previous selections.
    (Before, you only had *one* cursor/bar to move around for selections)

    A good example of this capability is the main PetASCII to ASCII
    converter (SHIFT-F9) with its list selections, check box and
    confirmation buttons. Selecting a conversion type (i.e. "Auto-Detect")
    and checking the checkbox will still show the convert type "highlited"
    in a different color (button select color).

  * The windows affected are as follows:
    * History
    * Change Drive
    * Convert Files
    * D64 BamEdit (F3 key only)
    * Color Configuration (main and subwindows)
    * Program Configuration (main window only)
    * PETASCII to ASCII Converter (main window)
    * User Menu
    * Create Archive Files
    * Macro Control
    * Text Editor (ASCII chart only)
    * Format Image (main window only)
    * CheckD64/T64/LNX (initial window only)

  * When entering a group of "confirmation" buttons (OK/CANCEL) using
    cursor up or cursor down, the default button will always be selected
    first.


* Major changes to the Convert routine.

  * Rewrote/restructured large portions (for both yours and my sake), to
    make it more modular.

  * It now defaults to putting all selected files into *one* archive (like
    LNX has always done). You can override this behaviour with the button
    "Create separate files", present on the main Convert window.

  * Filenames with "~" in them (i.e. Win95 longnames) use too fail.

  * Now handles long filenames, both source and destination.


* Some changes to the 64COPY.EXE "shell" loader:

  * Added a version check. If the version of the program and the loader are
    not matched, the program will quit with a "Loader error". This way, you
    cannot accidentally mix/match old/new versions of the program (which
    can cause *wierd* problems).

  * Loader now displayes the message "Launching 64COPY...".


* Added a Panel Layout Editor, to customize the look of all the panel types
  (DOS, D64,T64, P00/LNX). It is available on the Options menu, called
  "panel layout...".

  * Removed the panel information from the INI and moved it to a new file
    "64COPY.PAN"


* Some changes to the Text Editor search/replace function:

  * The "case sensitive" switch would not be honoured after the first find
    and/or replace.

  * Changing the search case option would not be seen until the Editor was
    re-entered. Also changed the style of the button from a "( )"
    sub-button to a "[ ]" check-button.

  * If you tried to replace a text string with another string that
    contained the original search string, it would replace the section of
    new string that matched the old string with the new string, etc. (i.e.
    search/replace "win" with "cur_win" would cause the following cascade:
    "cur_win", "cur_cur_win", "cur_cur_cur_win" etc).


* You can now turn off the title bar (top of screen) under the
  Configuration/Visual Options, called "Show menubar".


* All HISTORY commands are now stored in the INI, so they will be available
  the next time you start the program.


* Added new colors:

  * "Button Selected" to several windows
  * "Program titlebar" to the Other colors window


* Added "WipeFile" button to the Delete window.


* If a menu was dropped, the screen saver was active, the mouse pointer was
  over one of the menu items and a key was pressed to deactivate the screen
  saver, the program would think the mouse had been clicked, and acted on
  the click.


* The time estimate in the copy/move status window would sometimes display
  a "99" for the hours.


* When deleting directories, they would always be WipeFile'd.


* The "File Exists" collision window was too narrow.


* Added into the README.TXT some details of things I *won't* add into the
  program like GCR image reading (the new C64s and Per Hakan's CCS64
  format) and (likely) 6-pack ZipCode support (rare anyways).


* HELP file updates and spelling corrections.


* Red error windows now have a varying number of buttons (either "OK" by
  itself or "OK" and "CANCEL"), depending on whether you can cancel the
  operation at hand. If not, only the "OK" will be present. Also, the
  default selected button will vary, depending on the circumstances.


* The Change Label (SHIFT F10) function would try to change the volume
  labels on LBR and ARK files.


* Print Files would leave the "Printing..." dialog box behind, using up and
  not releasing the window.


* Additions to the FORMATS documents:

  * Included section under FORMATS/Conlude regarding thank-you for testers.
  * Added Power64 saved-file layout.


* Combined all the CHANG??.TXT files into one CHANGES.TXT.


* The Config/Miscellaneous button "ALT key drops menus" is now defaulted
  "off". With it on under Win95 and you task-switch using ALT-ESC, the menu
  would stay dropped down.


* PC64 files would not be displayed when the panel Filter was set to "Show
  only emulator files".


* The error offset counter in the ZipCode to D64 conversion was showing
  incorrect values sometimes.


* When "Trace chain" in the D64 HEX Editor has finished it will tell you
  how many sectors there were in the chain.


* When doing a SHIFT-F6 "Rename only", if the destination filename already
  exists, the duplicate file will no longer be deleted automatically.


* Changed the format for the backup color files (again!) that you can save
  from the Color Config window. Hopefully it is now a program version
  independant format (i.e. no CRC check, no version check).


* The Viewer will now sample the files to be viewed to determine if it
  should initially be viewed in TEXT or RAW mode.


* Typing "EXIT" on the command-line will quit the program.


* The RIGHT mouse button now handles double-clicking, as is evidenced in
  the Panel Layout Editor. It is not used much else through the program.


* Added a new button to the Screen Saver setup under Configuration called
  "Test Savers". When clicked, this will bring up another window where you
  can select specific screen savers and "test run" them, to see if there
  are some you don't want to use.


* C64 (ARK, D64) that contain A0's (padding characters) in the filename
  will now display the full name, and not get cut off after the first A0.
