 you.  By my power as caretaker...
 </Text>

you again.  You may use the museum
exhibits or explore the lands
outside.`pause`</Text>
      <Text ID="2">`white`"Welcome to our museum!  I am the
museum caretaker.  Although my
influence outside this museum is
limited, I'll provide you with help
and information whenever I can."`pause`
`clear`"Right now, you should explore the
world around you.  Feel free to use
the museum exhibits or, if you'd
rather, use the doors to go directly 
outside."`pause`</Text>
      <Text ID="3">`white`I've heard that your magic scroll
was stolen.  My sources say that it
was sold a few days later on the 
black market."`pause`</Text>
      <Text ID="10">`white`"The sceptor and crown!  This is truly
a great day for the tarmalon museum.
I want you to have this `cyan`magic ice`white`.  It
may help you someday.  It works best 
inside."`pause`</Text>

    <Exhibit ID="1">
      <Text ID="1">Welcome, noble traveler, to this
galactic museum on the planet of 
tarmalon.  The museum provides `white`views
`cyan`and `yellow`gateways`cyan` to the many fascinating
aspects of planetary life.`pause`
`clear`Use standard coins to view exhibits.
Please do not give away coins, or
feed the tarmalon natives.  Have a
nice day!`pause`</Text>

    <Exhibit ID="2">
      <Text ID="1">Eons ago, nomadic warriors roamed the
planet tarmalon.  They hunted and
fought with stone knives, much like
the one you see in this exhibit.`wait`
`clear`This knife is primitive - but
effective.  As a museum patron, you 
may take it for as long as ou like.
The knife is now in your inventory.`wait`</Text>
      <Text ID="2">As Tarmalon culture advanced, weapons
developed a ceremonial importance.
In this exhibit you see the famed
`white`staff of sacrifice.`cyan`  It was used to
coronate kings.`wait`
`clear`Although intended for ceremony, the
staff is actually bladed for combat.
As a museum patron, you may use this
weapon for as long as you like.  It
is now in your possession.</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="3">
      <Text ID="1">This exhibit shows a typical tarmalon
town called thornberry.  The town was 
established over 100 lifespans ago by
a group of wealthy merchants.`pause`
`clear`Thornberry has changed little since
its founding.  The rich and the poor
still live on opposite sides of town
separated by a massive stone wall.`pause`
`clear`Despite its inequity, thornberry is
a bustling community, containing
shops, craftsmen, banks, and places
of amusement.`pause`
</Text>
      <Text ID="2">Here's some `yellow`gold`cyan` to spend on
your trip.

    <Exhibit ID="4">
      <Text ID="1">Here you see a replica of the famous
`purple`enchanted flower fountain`cyan`.  Legend
says that its waters once flowed in
splendor.`pause`
`clear`One day a tulip was taken from the
fountain gardens and the fountain
waters stopped.  The stories say that
only when that flower is returned 
will the fountain flow again.`pause`
`clear``white`Myth or fact?  `cyan`Judge for yourself.
In either case, the museum has agreed
to help search for the tulip.</Text>
      <Text ID="2">Bring the tulip back here for a nice
reward.  Meanwhile, here's some native
`yellow`gold`cyan` to aid you in your search.

    <Exhibit ID="5">
      <Text ID="1">Tarmalon's deep ocean waters are so
turbulent that few trading ships ever
venture far from shore.  Yet, long
ago, the oceans were calm and ocean
travel flourished.`pause`
`clear`As time went by, pirates came to rule
the seas.  They preyed on helpless 
vessels, taking gold, weapons, armor
and supplies.`pause`
`clear`Their treasures were stored in deep
caves on remote islands.  This booty
was guarded by paid soldiers and by
animals bred for their ferocity.`pause`
`clear`When the oceans became rougher, many
of the caves could no longer be
reached.  In this exhibit, you see
the entrance to one such cave.  The
wealth stored within is enormous.`pause`
</Text>
      <Text ID="2">`white`The pirate's lair is located in a
chain of islands called the "three
sisters."  You will be transported
to the largest island.  From there,
you're on your own.`pause`
`clear`The pirate's lair has many levels.
At the very bottom, it is said, lies
a priceless sapphire!</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="6">
      <Text ID="1">Planet natives believe in the curative
power of a variety of "healing herbs."
However, the effectiveness of these
plants has never been verified by
museum personnel.`pause`
`clear`This display contains a `green`juton bush`cyan`.
According to lore, its fruit increases
the power of other native herbs.`pause`
`clear`While this claim is doubtful, the
fruit is really quite tasty.  You may
sample one.`pause`</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="7">
      <Text ID="1">Different planets have different
treasures.  On Tarmalon, as on
many planets, the scarcity of `yellow`gold`cyan`
makes it exceedingly valuable.`pause`
`clear`Here you see the museum currency room.
It contains a small (but noteworthy)
portion of the planet's wealth.  You
are welcome to a sample.`pause``clear`</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="8">
      <Text ID="1">`white`Stones of wisdom`cyan` is probably the most
popular bar-room game on tarmalon.
It is not only fun, but said to help
develop a player's intelligence.`pause`</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="9">
      <Text ID="1">This giant tapestry is actually a map
of the planet Tarmalon.  It's the only
remaining world map made by tarmalon
natives.`pause`
`clear`This museum is located in the north-
east portion of the main continent.
Baron Kelfor's castle is on an island
in the major inland lake.`pause`
`clear`Near the bottom left of the tapestry,
you can see the chain of islands
called the "three sisters."  A large
pirate's lair is said to be on one
of these islands.`pause`</Text>

    <Exhibit ID="10">
      <Text ID="1">As you well know, some exhibits in
this museum can be deadly.  But you
haven't even seen the most dangerous
displays.`pause`
`clear`Many years ago, the innermost section
of this museum was blocked off.  Some
exhibits found there were just too
dangerous.  Museum insurance rates
were skyrocketing!`pause`
`clear`Since you have succeeded where many
others have failed, this part of
the museum will be open to you from
now on.  Perhaps you have a chance.
Probably, you don't.`pause`</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="11">
      <Text ID="1">The underground catacombs of armak
are infamous for their twisting
passageways and deadly monsters.
To venture there, it is said, is
almost certain death.`pause`
`clear`Yes, for many years, the rulers of
Tarmalon have cast their `white`best`cyan` knights
into these dungeon depths.  Only a
few ever make it back to the surface.`pause`
`clear`Those who survive become `green`tougher`cyan`,
`yellow`fiercer`cyan`, and `purple`wiser`cyan`.  They emerge
virtually unbeatable in battle.`pause`
`clear`You now face the same test, for in a
moment, you'll find yourself at the
very `yellow`bottom`cyan` of armak.  The way out
lies far above.  `white`The risk is great -
the payoff greater!!`pause`</Text>
    </Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="13">Legends say that 13 great wizards
once ruled Tarmalon, but that little
of their power remains.  Those who
escaped death and treachery ultimately
succumbed to the ravages of time.`pause`
`clear`The wax figure before you is the
wizard of arovyn.  His power largely
gone, he is said to be imprisoned deep
within Kelfor castle.  Only the pass-
word `yellow`"Guardians"`cyan` will open his door.`pause`</Exhibit>
    <Exhibit ID="14">
      <Text ID="1">This magnificent beast was found
frozen to a high cliff near the
museum.`pause`
`clear`Locals say that `white`pegasus`cyan` stood alert
for over a lifespan - poised as if
ready to fly.  Finally, the magical
animal succumbed to the bitter cold.`pause`
`clear``white`Suddenly, the ice covering pegasus
cracks apart!  The winged horse looks
at you with probing eyes, and then
lowers one wing, as if asking you to
climb on.`pause`</Text>
